# ClinDoc AI  
### Deterministic Clinical Documentation Optimization & MCG Admission Engine  

A production-oriented deterministic clinical NLP system that transforms unstructured emergency department documentation into structured clinical intelligence and MCG-aligned admission reasoning.

This version removes probabilistic LLM dependence and implements a fully rule-based, severity-weighted, multi-domain clinical reasoning pipeline suitable for transparent clinical decision support simulation.

# 🏗 System Design Principles

## 1️⃣ Deterministic Signal Construction

All clinical findings are extracted via structured pattern recognition:

- Regex-based numeric lab detection  
- Oxygen saturation normalization  
- Structured comorbidity parsing  
- Imaging keyword recognition  
- Treatment escalation detection  
- Functional risk extraction  

No hallucination. No probabilistic drift.

## 2️⃣ Multi-System Severity Model

Severity scoring is weighted across domains:

| Domain        | Examples                                                   |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pulmonary     | Hypoxemia, tachypnea, bilateral pneumonia                  |
| Renal         | Elevated BUN, Creatinine, reduced GFR                      |
| Infectious    | Leukocytosis, radiographic pneumonia                       |
| Coagulation   | INR elevation                                              |
| Escalation    | IV broad-spectrum antibiotics                              |
| Functional    | Assisted living, DNR/DNI                                   |
| Risk          | Advanced age, comorbidities                                |

Final structured output includes:

- severityScore  
- riskScore  
- totalScore  
- unsafeDischarge  
- level (admission determination)  

---

## 3️⃣ Structured Admission Narrative Generation

justification_builder.py generates:

- Expanded clinical summary  
- Multi-organ medical necessity rationale  
- Risk stratification explanation  
- Deterministic admission conclusion  

This simulates real utilization review documentation.

# 🔬 Clinical Intelligence Examples

### Example Signals Automatically Detected

- SpO2 88% → Hypoxemia  
- O2 4L NC → Oxygen requirement  
- Bilateral infiltrates → Severe pulmonary involvement  
- BUN 49 → Renal dysfunction  
- GFR 40 → Reduced renal reserve  
- INR 2.1 → Elevated bleeding risk  
- Vancomycin + Cefepime → Broad-spectrum IV escalation  
- DNR/DNI → Advanced directive risk  
- Assisted living → Functional dependency

# 📊 Severity Scoring Model

Weighted deterministic scoring example:

Hypoxemia +40  
Oxygen Requirement +25  
Bilateral Pneumonia +10  
Tachypnea +10  
Leukocytosis +10  
Elevated BUN +5  
Reduced GFR +5  
Elevated INR +5  
IV Antibiotics +15  
Advanced Age +5  
Comorbidities +5  
Functional Risk +3  

totalScore is capped at 100.

Admission levels:

- Inpatient – Unsafe for discharge  
- Inpatient – Strong MCG support  
- Inpatient – MCG supported  
- Inpatient – Consider admission  
- Observation / Outpatient
